# Targets App

A simple and lighthearted app to record and track income, expenses, savings and free money left over.

## Income
Straightforward, record your income to keep track.

## Targets
Fun way to keep track of savings towards desired items and experiences. Instead of "savings", it's called "targets" for a mindset shift.

## Vacuums
Another mindset term to put in perspective certain expenses. Who knows, seeing some expenses as a vacuum may change personal motivation to continue letting that expense to suck up money.

## Ballin'
The most fun mindset. Instead of just seeing it as "free money", let's get an even more morale booster by viewing it as "Ballin'" money.
